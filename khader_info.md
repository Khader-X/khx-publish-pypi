# **First PyPI Organization**
- name: KHX
- Prefix "khx_" is used in my ALL PyPI packages. Example: `khx_rich_console`
- Explanation: KHX stands for "Khader X" where X is a variable that can be replaced by anything. It is used to represent my personal brand and identity in the Python community. Also, "X" represents the unknown, the variable, and the limitless possibilities of what I can achieve with my education, skills and knowledge in Python programming. It signifies my willingness to explore new ideas, take on challenges, and push the boundaries of what is possible with Python. Overall, KHX represents my passion for Aerospace Engineering and Python programming and my commitment to excellence in everything I do.
